"Rename the page /cover-letter-generator to /cover-letter. When a user opens this page, they should see two options:

Upload Resume:

If the user uploads a resume, it should be displayed on the screen.

Alongside the resume, there should be an input field where the user can add job details.

There should also be a button labeled ‘Generate Cover Letter’.

When the user adds the resume and job details, a cover letter should be generated using the data from both.

Manual Fill Method:

If the user clicks the 'Fill Manually' button, a form should open where they can enter their personal data.

Based on this manually entered information, a professional cover letter should be generated.

The generated cover letter should follow a professional template like this one:
